# Data Validation Pipeline#


- This Python code implements a data validation pipeline for agricultural field data. 
- The pipeline is designed to ingest, clean, and validate the field data using nearby weather station data.

# Features#


- Field Data Processing: The pipeline ingests agricultural field data from a SQLite database, performs data cleaning operations such as renaming columns and applying corrections, and maps weather station data to the field data based on field IDs.

- Statistical Analysis: The pipeline calculates means and variances for both the field data and the weather station data. It then performs hypothesis testing using a t-test to determine whether the field data is representative of reality based on the weather-related data from nearby stations.

- Extensibility: The pipeline is built to be easily extendable for future use. It includes modular functions for data processing, statistical analysis, and result interpretation. Additionally, it utilizes logging to track the processing steps and potential errors.
